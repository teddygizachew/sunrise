## Amplication Cloud (SaaS)

Launch Amplication from [app.amplication.com](http://app.amplication.com/)

## Development Environment (Local)

### System Requirements

:bulb: Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js v16 or above](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git/)


### Initializing all the packages

Amplication is using a monorepo with multiple packages. To initialize all the packages on a local development environment, including running a docker image for the DB and seeding the DB.

1. Execute the following commands in the project root folder:

```jsx
npm install
npm run setup:dev
```
This will install all the required dependencies, run the necessary scripts and init a Docker-based Postgres server.

2. Go to `.../packages/amplication-server` and execute the following command:

```jsx
npm run start
```

3. Go to `.../packages/amplication-client` and execute the following command:

```jsx
npm run start
```




### Setting Up Amplication Manually

You can use a manual step-by-step approach to set up Amplication in a local development environment. To do so, you should follow the following instructions for **Setting Up Amplication Server**, and **Setting Up Amplication Client**.

#### Setting up [Amplication Server](https://github.com/amplication/amplication/blob/master/packages/amplication-server/README.md)

Amplication Server is the main component of the platform that provides all the core functionality to design and create low-code applications.
The server exposes a GraphQL API for all actions. The server is built with the following awesome open-source technologies: Node.js, NestJS, Prisma over PostgreSQL, GraphQL API, and many more...

#### Setting Up [Amplication Client](https://github.com/amplication/amplication/blob/master/packages/amplication-client/README.md)

Amplication Client is the front end of the platform that provides you with an easy-to-drive UI for building your next low-code application.
The client is based on React, Apollo client, Primer components, React Material Web Components, Formik, and more.

# Version 1

Amplication is currently in its version 1.  This is the first major release of Amplication with enterprise-grade production readiness & scale. In this version, we have introduced multiple new features and enhanced the existing ones. The feature set is listed above in the [Features](#features) section.
